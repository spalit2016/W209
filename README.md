## About


The visualizations below are based on NYPD's(New York Police Department) dataset of every collision in NYC by location and injury from 2013 to 2018. NYPD started collecting this data to comply with the local law #11 passed by NYC council in 2011. This data is manually run every month and reviewed by the TrafficStat Unit before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents a collision in NYC by city, borough and cross street.

The visualizations presented here aim to minimize vehicle collisions in New York City by providing relevant insights to general New Yorkers, commuters, city planners, traffic police officials and DMV officials to help promoting commuter awareness and planning better traffic management.
